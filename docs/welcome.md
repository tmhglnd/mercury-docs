# üåï Mercury Live Coding Environment 

**Mercury is a free/open-source, beginner-friendly, minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music performances**

In the menu on the left side you can find everything you need, from [About](about) and [Getting Started](getting-started) to Tips&Tricks, How-To's and the [Reference](./reference/syntax.md). Also make sure you check out the [Collaborative Coding](collaborate) chapter, because making music together is fun!

<!-- Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) (you're in the right place)
* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground) -->

[**üöÄ Start coding directly in the playground!**](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

## ‚ú® Inspiration

During the development of Mercury (both the playground and the full version) I've found inspiration in many other live coding environments, practices and platforms. Some of these are:

- [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) - Live coding visual synthesizer by Olivia Jack
- [Sema](https://sema.codes/about) - Live coding language design platform combined with Machine Learning
- [MIMIC Project](https://mimicproject.com/about) - a web platform for the artistic exploration of musical machine learning and machine listening.
- [Tidal](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome) - Live coding of patterns
- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) - The live coding synth for everyone
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) - Webaudio framework for programming synths and sequencers
- [Nearley](https://nearley.js.org/) - Parsing toolkit
